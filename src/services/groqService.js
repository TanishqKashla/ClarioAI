3. Provide concise but informative description for the subtopic
5. List 3-4 specific focus areas for each subtopic, these should be the key areas that a student should focus on while studying the subtopic. number of focus areas may vary according to the topic, but it should be relevant to the subtopic.
6. Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text or formatting
7. Make sure you only return one JSON array for the subject name`;

üß† Very Important: "${subtopic}" must be explained strictly within the context of "${topic}" under the umbrella of "${subject}". Do not generalize the subtopic or drift into other disciplines or applications unless explicitly instructed. Always prioritize relevance to the specified topic and subject.

Please include:

1. üéØ **Introduction**  
   - Define the subtopic clearly in context.  
   - Why is it important or useful within "${topic}"?

2. üìö **Key Concepts & Terminology**  
   - Explain important concepts, features, or terms.  
   - Use section-wise breakdowns with clear subheadings.

3. üíª **Code/Examples (if applicable)**  
   - Provide language-specific, context-relevant examples.  
   - Show proper usage and best practices.

4. üåç **Use Cases / Applications**  
   - Describe how it applies in real-world scenarios ‚Äî but still tied to the current domain.

5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls / Misconceptions**  
   - Mention things people often get wrong in this subtopic.

6. üìå **Summary Checklist / Table**  
   - Create a compact reference guide at the end.

üó£Ô∏è **Tone & Style**  
- Friendly, not overly academic  
- Structured and beginner-friendly, but useful for professionals too  
- Use bullets, icons (üìåüõ†Ô∏è‚úÖ), and tables sparingly to aid readability

üéØ **Assume your audience is a curious learner ‚Äî not necessarily a student or expert.**
